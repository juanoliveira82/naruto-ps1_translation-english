## Translation of the cards

The game uses a lot of cards during the rounds you play, so I'm going to translate them for better understanding.

### Cards Selection Menu

| - | Text in-game  | Translation
--- | --- | ---
Top Label | ゲットする扎を えらべ! | Select the one you want to get!
Description Box | もらうチャンス札をえらんでね。 | Choose a chance tag to get it.
**O** Button | けってい | Confirm

I improved the translation of "Choose a chance tag to get it." to "Choose a chance card to get.".
