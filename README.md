## Translation project for the game "Naruto Shinobi no Sato no Jintori Kassen"

The project consists of translating the game texts that are in Japanese into English, so it would be easy to understand the game.

I don't know how to rom-hack, so I will only translate the game.

## How I translate

I use the psx 1.13 emulator to play the game, so I watch the Japanese symbols that appear on the screens, and I use a virtual Japanese keyboard to write the words, trying to find the symbols that are the same as those that appear in the game.

Then I translate Japanese words and phrases into English using Google Translate.
