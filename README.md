## 💻 Project

The project consists of translating the game texts that are in Japanese into English, so it would be easy to understand the game.

I don't know how to rom-hack, so I will only translate the game.

## 🤔 How I translate

I used the psx 1.13 emulator to play the game. I am now using the [DuckStation](https://github.com/stenzek/duckstation) emulator to play.

Within the game, when I see the Japanese symbols that appear on the screens, I use a Japanese virtual keyboard to write the words, trying to find the symbols that are the same as those that appear in the game.

Then I translate Japanese words and phrases into English using Google Translate.
