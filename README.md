## Translation project for the game "Naruto Shinobi no Sato no Jintori Kassen"

The project consists of translating the game texts that are in Japanese into English, so it would be easy to understand the game.

I don't know how to rom-hack, so I will only translate the game.

## How I translate

I use the psx 1.13 emulator to play the game, so I see the Japanese symbols that appear on the screens, and I use a virtual Japanese keyboard to write the words, trying to find the symbols that are the same as those that appear in the game.

Then I translate Japanese words and phrases into English using Google Translate.

## Main Menu

| - | Text in-game  | Translation
--- | --- | ---
**X** Button | もどる | Return
**O** Button | けってい | Confirm

## Options Menu (Kakashi Image)

| - | Text in-game  | Translation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Top Label | せってい | Set |

The top label translates to "Set", but I preferred to translate to "Options", since this is the options menu.

| - | Text in-game  | Translation
--- | --- | ---
1st setting | 振動 | Vibration
2nd setting | サウンド | Sound
1st sound option | ステレオ | Stereo
2nd sound option | モノラル | Monaural

I didn't translate Iruka's sentences as he probably just explains the options.
