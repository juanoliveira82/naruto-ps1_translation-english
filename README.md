## Translation project for the game "Naruto Shinobi no Sato no Jintori Kassen"

The project consists of translating the game texts that are in Japanese into English, so it would be easy to understand the game.

I don't know how to rom-hack, so I will only translate the game.

## How I translate

I use the psx 1.13 emulator to play the game, so I see the Japanese symbols that appear on the screens, and I use a virtual Japanese keyboard to write the words, trying to find the symbols that are the same as those that appear in the game.

Then I translate Japanese words and phrases into English using Google Translate.

I improved the translation to: "You can see the Bingo Book".

| Top Label | せってい | Set |

The top label translates to "Set", but I preferred to translate to "Options", since this is the options menu.

**1st setting** | 振動 | Vibration
Iruka phrase | 振動のせつていをするぞ! | I will set the vibration!
**2nd setting** | サウンド | Sound
Iruka phrase | サウンドのせつていをするぞ! | I will set the sound!
*1st sound option* | ステレオ | Stereo
*2nd sound option* | モノラル | Monaural
**Save button** | ロード | Load *(the memory card)* → Save
Iruka phrase | データをロードするぞ! | Let's save the data!
