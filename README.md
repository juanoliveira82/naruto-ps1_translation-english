## 💻 Project

The project consists of translating the game texts that are in Japanese into English, so it would be easy to understand the game.

We don't know how to rom-hack, so we will only translate the game.

## 🤔 How We Translate?

You are free to run the game however you prefer.
Also, you can use [this](https://github.com/stenzek/duckstation) to run. 

You are free to use whichever translation method you prefer. 
We will describe ours below.

[Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/) have a handwriting area when you can draw the glyph and the translator will suggest some characters, where you can choose the most similar one

[This site](https://www.i2ocr.com/free-online-japanese-ocr#) is also very useful. You can upload an image to it and it will try to tell you which characters are in the image.

So we put the string of characters into Google Translate, from Japanese to English, and try to see if it makes sense.
